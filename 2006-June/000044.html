Hi Frans,

I had just begun looking into that, but was interrupted by the good  
news that you had fixed it.

&gt;<i> There's a MATLABVERSION variable declared, but it's not used to  
</I>&gt;<i> locate the matlab resources, such as mex.h
</I>
I can't find &quot;MATLABVERSION&quot; in the project, either in the source or  
the target settings.  Where is it?

&gt;<i> Requires editing the actual file locations all the time, which is a  
</I>&gt;<i> pity.
</I>
That sounds incorrect.

It should be necessary only to change the value of the  
&quot;MATLAB_DIR_NAME&quot; variable in each target setting.  That is the  
canonical reference within the PTB Xcode project; All paths to MATLAB  
resources used by mex targets derive from that variable.  For  
example, the Eyelink target defines header search paths to be:
  $(SYSTEM_APPS_DIR)/$(MATLAB_DIR_NAME)/extern/include $ 
(SYSTEM_APPS_DIR)/$(MATLAB_DIR_NAME)/simulink/include

That is still one change per target (mex file), not one change.   
However, &quot;MATLAB_DIR_NAME&quot; is also defined in the project settings,  
as well as in each target setting.  I think if we deleted the  
MATLAB_DIR_NAME definitions from each target, then each target would  
inherit the project's definition of that variable.  That would be one  
switch, not one switch per target.  The flexibility to set separately  
for each mex target the MATLAB lib directory is unnecessary.

A good way to set this up would be to keep the per-target  
MATLAB_DIR_NAME  definitions and create build configurations which  
switch between MATLAB directories.  There is the super-convenient  
&quot;build configuration&quot; drop-down menu at the top left corner of the  
Xcode main window.    That seems like a really good way to deal with  
problem that not all developers have the same version of MATLAB, but  
we share the same Psychtoolbox Xcode project.

&gt;<i> It's not clear how to use the variable in the filepath though  
</I>&gt;<i> (editing XML file?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Definitely unnecessary and potentially harmful to edit any Xcode  
project file.  Any changes made to the Xcode project settings can be  
made using the Xcode gui.  Only Xcode should read the and write the  
project configuration files because any changes made outside of that  
risk corrupting those files.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frameworks:
</I>&gt;<i> What is the correct frameworks that should be used?
</I>
The most recent is usually the best.

&gt;<i> Quicktime.framework was pointing to a folder in universal SDK  
</I>&gt;<i> folder, rather than the framework in System/Library/
</I>
Stuff which finds its way into System/Library/ is sometimes released  
in advance from ADC in an SDK .   So is the Quicktime SDK the most  
recent framework, or has it been superseded by a system update?

&gt;<i> Most other frameworks point to the latter location. But the CHUD  
</I>&gt;<i> framework is not in this place.
</I>
Apple decides where in the filesystem their frameworks reside.  I  
don't know what rules Apple uses for deciding what to put where.  It  
might be that anything installed with the OS goes into System/ 
Library/ but separate add-ons go elsewhere.  That rule is consistent  
with the examples which you have given.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eyelink.core.framework points to a location in System/Library/ 
</I>&gt;<i> Frameworks/ but this should presumably be /Library/Frameworks/ as  
</I>&gt;<i> this is were the installer of the eyelinkapi  put the files.
</I>
I would expect so.  It works one way and not the other?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why are all executables called (e4xecutable_name)_OLD?
</I>
Because they are generated by eponymous targets named &quot;*_OLD&quot;.  Xcode  
does not list executables for the new targets in its &quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot;  
pane.  That's ok, we don't need them there.

I left the old targets in the project until I was sure that everyone  
was ok with the new ones.  I appended &quot;_OLD&quot; to these to distinguish  
them from the new targets.   If the new eyelink mex target works for  
you then we can delete all of the old targets except for PsychSound.   
(Last I checked neither the old nor new Psychsound target would  
build.)  We can also delete corresponding &quot;*_OLD&quot;  executables and  
retain only the MATLAB executable.  We can also get rid of the now  
unnecessary info.plist files and their references in the PTB Xcode  
project.    That would clear out a lot of clutter.

FYI there are multiple changes between old and new targets,  
significantly I fixed problems in the build settings which caused  
&quot;clear mex&quot; not to work.  See svn commit logs at Berlios for more  
details, some time around last fall.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ScreenMakeTexture and PsychCellGlue compile but with warnings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok.


Best,

Allen
