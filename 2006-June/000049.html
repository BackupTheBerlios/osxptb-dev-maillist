<PRE>Hi Allen,

you can merge your changes whenever you want. With changes of others i'd 
say, read the associated log messages and decide if they sound like 
something that's safe to merge. One can merge a specific subset of 
changes via &quot;svn merge -r start:end trunk/ beta/&quot;  where start is the 
revision number of the first thing to merge, end the one of the last 
thing to include. When i merge from trunk i usually try to merge 
everything since the last merge into beta to make life simple, i.e., svn 
merge -r lastmergedrevision:HEAD trunk/ beta/

I only omit (merge around) other peoples change if the log messages 
sound like the changes could break functionality in beta, or they are 
not yet well tested.

My own rules are like:

1. Whatever is committed into trunk should at least compile and not 
severely break functionality, so other developers can always update from 
trunk and work on the code without having to fight bugs introduced by 
others. -&gt; Either make small incremental commits or commit consistent 
chunks.

-&gt; That's what you do as well.

2. Code merged into beta should be somewhat stable, as many people use 
beta for real work -- which is encouraged, given that stable is many 
month behind beta. It's ok if new features are merged into beta that 
don't break old features of beta, even if this new features are 
incomplete, work in progress, e.g., fine-tuning and more debugging 
needed, interface subject to change. Only code in stable should not 
change in functionality or interface (well more functionality is always 
good, but removing functionality, massive incompatible change to 
behaviour or interface are not good), as people should be able to rely 
on &quot;code working with stable at point t still works with the same 
behaviour at t + x month&quot;.

3. I often commit &quot;mostly working, but not yet completely polished&quot; 
features into beta to simplify merging, but i simply don't announce them 
on the forum until i'm confident they are really ok.

best,
-mario
