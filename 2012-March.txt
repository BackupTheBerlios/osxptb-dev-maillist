Silver we found out that the Trigger-input of FORP is
detected by KbCheck as a press of the "t" key, but not the
response buttons, so there must be a firmware solution.

I assume the PsychHID('GetReport') function detects FORP
actions because it samples the USB bus with high temporal
resolution and buffers the results, but i'm not very
familiar with that part of PsychHID, so...

There's not much i could do about it at the moment as i
have trouble recompiling the PsychHID part of PTB, but if
my guess is correct then there is no need to do anything
about it, except to provide a working GetChar or e-mail the
manufacturer of FORP...

Maybe you want to forward this e-mail to the FORP guys and
ask them? I don't have the time at the moment - and i don't
have the equipment to test anything or a strong "valued
customer" relationship to them ;-)

best,
-mario

The Berlios Subversion How To:

Online doc for Subversion:  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

David Brainard is the project admin, so he needs to add you to the list of
developers.

I'll comment more on the code when it's committed.
