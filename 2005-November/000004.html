<PRE>Hi Frans,

we have a new mailing-list for developer discussion on
Berlios, i thought maybe you're interested in subscribing:

&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=5064">http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=5064</A>&gt;

Regarding your FORP bug. Michael Silver had the same issue.
I suspect that its not a bug in KbCheck but correct
behaviour with respect to a device that advertises itself
as a regular keyboard but doesn't behave like a regular
keyboard.

(Completely unverified) Theory goes like this:

A normal keyboard sends a &quot;key pressed&quot; event to the OS
when a key is pressed down. It sends a &quot;key released&quot;
event, when the key is finally released . The OS detects
any temporal sequence of &quot;key X pressed&quot; followed by &quot;key X
released&quot; as a single key stroke, maps it into the
corresponding character and stores it in the event queue.
This event queue is queried/polled by all normal
applications like the Matlab command window or text
editors, as well as the GetChar command of PTB.
KbCheck/KbWait otoh always report the *current* state of
all keys at query-time. So a key is reported as &quot;down&quot; in
the time interval between the arrival of the &quot;key pressed&quot;
event and the &quot;key released&quot; event.

My assumption is that the FORP - on detection of a key
press - sends a &quot;key pressed&quot; event, immediately followed
by a &quot;key released&quot; event. It doesn't send the &quot;key
released&quot; event when the key is really released, but
before. This is convenient for a response button box to
have this &quot;debouncing mechanism&quot; and should be handled
properly by GetChar or Matlab or text editors, but KbCheck
would pretty likely miss the short time-window between &quot;key
press&quot; and &quot;key release&quot;...

If this is really the case then KbCheck works properly
although not as expected and GetChar should solve the FORP
issue.

So solution would be either:
a) Use GetChar instead of KbCheck -- when GetChar works
again.
or
b) Ask the manufacterer of FORP to extend their Firmware
with a new mode of  operation to make FORP really behave
like a keyboard.
