<PRE>Hello all,

the beta-branch of OS-X Psychtoolbox has
received a massive update with lots of new
experimental features:

- Support for Offscreen windows is back:

  Screen('OpenOffscreenWindow'),
  and Screen('CopyWindow')
  are back and should mostly behave like
  they did in the past.

  Drawing to Offscreen windows is possible
  again.

  Offscreen windows are implemented as
  OpenGL textures, just like the textures that
  you can create via Screen('MakeTexture'),
  therefore you can mostly use Textures and
  Offscreen windows interchangeably, e.g,
  draw an Offscreen window via the 'DrawTexture'
  function...

* Some kind of compatibility mode to the old
  drawing model of the MacOS-9 PTB has been
  added. If you add the following line:

  Screen('Preference','EmulateOldPTB',1)

  to the top of your script (before any other Screen-
  call), then PTB tries to behave like the old PTB.

  The Screen('WaitBlanking') command then works
  again and all drawing commands take effect
  immediately...

Please use this new features only if you either
need to draw to Offscreen windows, or if you are
absolutely unable to port OS-9 code to OS-X. Do
not use it for writing new code!!!

-&gt; Speed and efficiency of drawing in OS-9 mode
will be significantly lower than in OS-X mode.

-&gt; Memory consumption may be much higher.

-&gt; Stimulus presentation timing of the new
Screen('Flip') command is much more robust
and accurate than with the old WaitBlanking method.
Stimulus onset with 'Flip' is guaranteed to be well-
defined (down to the microsecond level) and
tear-free, whereas no such guarantees can be
made at all for the old WaitBlanking method.

-&gt; A huge number of new features as demonstrated
by some of the PsychDemos is only possible when
not using compatibility mode.

-&gt; This code hasn't received much testing, so it
may contain serious bugs. Support for
compatibility mode is a *very low* priority for me.
If you find problems, feel free to report them but
i won't make a commitment to fix any of the
reported problems in a short period of time (or
to fix them at all). If this proves to be too
troublesome, it will be removed again.

-&gt; So if you are a user of the old OS-9 PTB,
you may give it a try. If it works, it works, if it
doesn't it doesn't. Feel free to report the problems
and try to provide fixes for simple problems yourself.

What definitely doesn't work is any kind of CLUT
animation for now.

If you find that this release breaks any of your
existing OS-X code, please report it immediately.
Keeping OS-X PTB well working is a much higher
priority.

Finally, beta contains the initial release of the
OpenGL Psychtoolbox for Microsoft Windows.

This is a hybrid of the old and new PTB:

All M-Files are identical to the OS-X PTB.
The Screen - Mex file is ported from the OS-X
PTB. All other Mex-files are identical to the ones
in the old Windows Psychtoolbox 2.54...

Screen is mostly feature compatible to the
Screen command in OS-X with the following
exceptions:

* Quicktime movie playback support is not
available until Apple manages to provide
a decent Quicktime-7 SDK for Windows
instead of the brain-damage that they
currently ship.

* Multi display support is limited. PTB can't
detect secondary displays of a multi-display
setup yet, but if &quot;Desktop spanning&quot; is enabled,
it can make use of a 2nd display for stereo-
display purpose. Just run &quot;StereoDemo(4)&quot; to
see how stereo-configurations are supported.
Read message 4147 for info on how to do this
on NVidia gfx-cards.

* CLUT animation is not yet possible, so
CLUTDemoOSX won't work, but linearizing
or gamma-correcting displays is possible. See
&quot;Screen LoadNormalizedGammaTable?&quot; for
explanation.

* Matlab version 5,6 and 7 should work.

Transition from old WinPTB to the new one will
be gradually. So if you are happy with your
current Win 2.54 setup, stick to it. If you want
to use one of the new features, give the beta
a try... This is a beta release, so it will certainly
contain some bugs that will take time to fix...

What else is new in this beta - release?

The flicker-test sheet has been removed which
used to show up on dual-display setups. It
used to confuse and annoy users. You can
find a new PerceptualVBLSyncTest.m test in
the PsychTest folder which is a good replacement.


Download works as follows:

If you already have the &quot;UpdatePsychtoolbox&quot; script,
then just follow its instructions.

If you are a new would-be user of 'beta', please
download:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/kleinerm/ptbosx/DownloadPsychtoolbox.m">http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bu/people/kleinerm/ptbosx/DownloadPsychtoolbox.m</A>&gt;

Put it into your Matlab path, type
&quot;help DownloadPsychtoolbox&quot; and follow the
instructions. Make sure to finally invoke
the script with the flavor argument set to
'beta' ...


Again, 'beta' contains experimental code for
integration into future official releases, so
test carefully, use with caution, don't bet
on it working out of the box flawlessly...

Good luck,
-mario
