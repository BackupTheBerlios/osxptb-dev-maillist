<PRE>Pardon the question - I'm fairly new to xcode. This old dog can learn 
new tricks, but sometimes I'm a little slow on the uptake.

I checked out the ptb source from berlios last week - Thanks, Chris.

I cannot seem to open the xcode project!?!

I'm assuming that the xcode proiject file is in 
PsychSourceGL/Projects/MacOSX/PsychToolbox/PsychToolbox.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

If I double click on this file in Finder then XCode starts, but there is 
no evidence that I've opened the project. For example under the Project 
tab all options (including &quot;Show Project&quot;) are gray. I've fumbled 
around, read docs, googled but all docs seem to assume that a developer 
will know how to open the project. Forgive me, I just don't know ......

Can anyone take a minute and set me straight?

Thanks,

Dan

</I>&gt;<i>Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There seems to be a growing interest in getting an OSX version of the
</I>&gt;<i>Eyelinktoolbox.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Quite a while ago (2 years?) we (Enno Peters that is) started working
</I>&gt;<i>on a version but were sort of stopped by the lack of a stable
</I>&gt;<i>psychtoolbox. I call this our early alpha version. It actually worked
</I>&gt;<i>to some extent. I haven't gotten back to it yet, due mainly to a lack
</I>&gt;<i>of time (and Enno leaving for a proper job).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Here's (a copy of) a message I wrote a while to another  wannabe
</I>&gt;<i>Eyelink porter (Daniel Sperka):
</I>&gt;<i>---------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>It would be timely if an OSX version of the Eyelink TB would come out
</I>&gt;<i>now. In my view the PTB is becoming really useful now, especially after
</I>&gt;<i>the improvements Mario Kleiner has been making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I believe a few months would be quite sufficient to get a working
</I>&gt;<i>version (like I mentioned, there is an early version that has some
</I>&gt;<i>functions working).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There's a couple of things that I think need to be changed/improved:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. Update to newest XCode/Matlab/PTB source code. Shouldn't be much of
</I>&gt;<i>an issue, but still.
</I>&gt;<i>2. Check for updates in code with SR Research.
</I>&gt;<i>3. Make sure we do not use any graphics other than via PTB (there is a
</I>&gt;<i>problem with the 'eye' graphic during calibration).
</I>&gt;<i>4. Seperate out functions from 'shell' very much like current PTB does.
</I>&gt;<i>This is not an absolute necessity, but using the same methods as the
</I>&gt;<i>current PTB presumably would make things easier to maintain in the long
</I>&gt;<i>run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>5. Update many of the .m files to use e.g. new graphics calls of PTB.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>6. Test everything for speed, delays, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>7. provide some support/updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The OS9 code can be downloaded from
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.psychtoolbox.org/eyelinktoolbox/downloads/">http://www.psychtoolbox.org/eyelinktoolbox/downloads/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>EyelinkToolbox_C_code_1.4.sit
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this is the most recent OS9 code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've traced some OSX code for you.  I am not entirely sure if it is
</I>&gt;<i>complete. Enno Peters wasn't a superbly organised programmer, and I
</I>&gt;<i>haven't looked at this project for quite a while.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Download from
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://cornelis.med.rug.nl/pub/eyelinktoolbox/code/EyelinkOSXCode19-10">http://cornelis.med.rug.nl/pub/eyelinktoolbox/code/EyelinkOSXCode19-10</A>
</I>&gt;<i>-05.zip
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In principle I am very much open to a collaboration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>--------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Here's a plan:
</I>&gt;<i>I am offering our code as a starter. If someone with a little time on
</I>&gt;<i>their hands (Chris?) would check the OSX source code into the/some CVS
</I>&gt;<i>server and do #1 on the list, that would be a step forward. (Then
</I>&gt;<i>please tell all other interested in development how to get to it.)
</I>&gt;<i>PTB in my view is about collaboration, rather than people reinventing
</I>&gt;<i>wheels (or even 30% of them). So, be fair and please use the head start
</I>&gt;<i>and collaborative opportunities available to create a full working
</I>&gt;<i>version of the ETB.
</I>&gt;<i>Also, it be nice if a reasonable degree of backward compatibility with
</I>&gt;<i>the OS9 version is maintained.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My proposal is that those interested in Eyelink TB programming reply to
</I>&gt;<i>me, so that we continue the discussion in that group (and decide where
</I>&gt;<i>to do this). I can tell a bit more also about our ideas back then about
</I>&gt;<i>what ETB should be doing (and what not).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Gr.
