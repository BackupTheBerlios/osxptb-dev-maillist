You're added as a developer and can now check code in as well
as out.

The general idea is that you can fold anything you want back into
the alpha trunk, it doesn't even have to work.  But checking in  
regularly
allows everyone to stay up to date.  Once you think is working, merge
the change into the beta trunk. Finally, the stable trunk represents
things that we think have been tested enough to be, well, stable.
SVN will enforce that you merge any changes where someone else
has checked something else in while you were working on it.

Sending a message to the developers (use the developer mailing list  
we set
up on Berlios, and cc'd above) about what you've modified is a good
idea.  You can subscribe to this list through Berlios, or just view the
list archive on the website.

More generally, I think we're all still feeling our way through how this
should go.  Marie has a longer version of the above, which he believes
represents best practice.  There has been some going back and forth
about whether we really need alpha, beta, and stable trunks or whether
two (or even one) would work OK.  Mario (or someone), it may be worth
reposting that traffic now that we have the dev mailing list -- I  
don't think
I have it handy.

But in any case, the main message is that fixes and contributions are
really welcome!

Best,

David
