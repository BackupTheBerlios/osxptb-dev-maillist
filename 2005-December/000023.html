<PRE>Dan and Frans,

I just checked in my source for the Eyelink Toolbox.  I did not have
access to the experiment machine I orginally set this up on, so I had
to start over from my backups on a new machine... unfortunately I ran
into several problems with XCode.  The Eyelink Target, as checked in
does not compile!  For whatever reason, XCode cannot find the Eyelink
Header file, eyelink.h.  I've included the eyelink_core.framework, and
I don't see any differences between the checked-in project and my
original project.  I'm at a loss.  XCode is very different than VC++,
and I'm still not up to speed on it's use of frameworks.

Some Hacks I used:
- Somewhere in the PsychToolbox.xcodeproj the Matlab directory is
assigned, but I can't find where.  grepping the file it's set to
MATLAB704.  I'm using vertion 7.1, so I created a symbolic link in
Applications directory for 7.04 to point to 7.1

- On my experiment machine, XCode couldn't find Frameworks outside of
the System folder, so I copied
/Library/Frameworks/eyelink_core.framework to
/System/Library/Frameworks/eyelink_core.framework.

Sorry, I hate checking in code that doesn't compile, but hopefully
it's a simple fix that will be obvious to someone else.  And I ran out
of time to work on this as I'm heading out of town for the week.  I'll
be back next week and can help more with it then.

Below is a copy of the email Frans sent me that includes the original
OSX port of the Eyelink Toolbox.  Much of the source can probably be
included in the project as is, but you'd want to give it a once-over.

Good Luck!
Chris


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear all,

There seems to be a growing interest in getting an OSX version of the
Eyelinktoolbox.

Quite a while ago (2 years?) we (Enno Peters that is) started working
on a version but were sort of stopped by the lack of a stable
psychtoolbox. I call this our early alpha version. It actually worked
to some extent. I haven't gotten back to it yet, due mainly to a lack
of time (and Enno leaving for a proper job).

Here's (a copy of) a message I wrote a while to another  wannabe
Eyelink porter (Daniel Sperka):
---------------------------------------------------------
It would be timely if an OSX version of the Eyelink TB would come out
now. In my view the PTB is becoming really useful now, especially after
the improvements Mario Kleiner has been making.

I believe a few months would be quite sufficient to get a working
version (like I mentioned, there is an early version that has some
functions working).

There's a couple of things that I think need to be changed/improved:

1. Update to newest XCode/Matlab/PTB source code. Shouldn't be much of
an issue, but still.
2. Check for updates in code with SR Research.
3. Make sure we do not use any graphics other than via PTB (there is a
problem with the 'eye' graphic during calibration).
4. Seperate out functions from 'shell' very much like current PTB does.
This is not an absolute necessity, but using the same methods as the
current PTB presumably would make things easier to maintain in the long
run.

5. Update many of the .m files to use e.g. new graphics calls of PTB.

6. Test everything for speed, delays, etc.

7. provide some support/updates.

The OS9 code can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.psychtoolbox.org/eyelinktoolbox/downloads/">http://www.psychtoolbox.org/eyelinktoolbox/downloads/</A>
EyelinkToolbox_C_code_1.4.sit
 I believe this is the most recent OS9 code.

I've traced some OSX code for you.  I am not entirely sure if it is
complete. Enno Peters wasn't a superbly organised programmer, and I
haven't looked at this project for quite a while.

Download from
<A HREF="http://cornelis.med.rug.nl/pub/eyelinktoolbox/code/EyelinkOSXCode19-10">http://cornelis.med.rug.nl/pub/eyelinktoolbox/code/EyelinkOSXCode19-10</A>
-05.zip

In principle I am very much open to a collaboration.

--------------------


Here's a plan:
I am offering our code as a starter. If someone with a little time on
their hands (Chris?) would check the OSX source code into the/some CVS
server and do #1 on the list, that would be a step forward. (Then
please tell all other interested in development how to get to it.)
PTB in my view is about collaboration, rather than people reinventing
wheels (or even 30% of them). So, be fair and please use the head start
and collaborative opportunities available to create a full working
version of the ETB.
Also, it be nice if a reasonable degree of backward compatibility with
the OS9 version is maintained.

My proposal is that those interested in Eyelink TB programming reply to
me, so that we continue the discussion in that group (and decide where
to do this). I can tell a bit more also about our ideas back then about
what ETB should be doing (and what not).

Gr.
Frans
