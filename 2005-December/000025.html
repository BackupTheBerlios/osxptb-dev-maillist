<PRE>Great! Another contributor :)

A few comments:

This is very important before checking in stuff to Subversion:

&quot;please don't forget - before committing to subversion - to run the
scripts in /trunk/managementtools/convertlinefeeds.sh shell script over
your Sourcecode. You see usage info at top of the script. It
replaces all CRLF (old style OS-9) linefeeds by LF linefeeds, in order
to be able to display the source code properly in other text editors
than XCode and to make Subversion happy.

Everybody developing for PTB should also set the setting in
XCode-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Editor-Tab for linefeed handling to &quot;Unix&quot; (LF)
style for old and new files!

Without this, most useful text processing tools, scripts and Subversion
will ***screw up***!&quot;

Regarding the different branches of PTB:

The &quot;alpha&quot; branch is dead - it was overkill. I'll delete that branch in 
the next days.

The &quot;trunk&quot; is were *all* development should happen. You shouldn't check 
in/commit changes that break trunk in the sense of leaving it completely 
dysfunctional or not compilable anymore, but you can commit new features 
that are non-functional or only half-finished, e.g., source code that is 
not yet integrated into the build process, source code where huge parts 
are commented out and such, or partially implemented code that you work 
on, but that others shouldn't touch because it may crash/malfunction.

This allows you to use Subversion as backup-system for your work, to 
keep the others well informed about what you are doing so they can 
probably give you feedback or adapt their own work to the changes. And 
it makes it easier to merge code. I usually do one commit per 
significant change, e.g., per new feature and such, so one can easily 
undo specific changes without trouble...

I'd ask/recommend you to write a log entry for each commit that explains 
in a few lines why and how you changed something. That helps to keep 
track of changes and how they possibly affect other parts of the system. 
Obviously for a trivial/small change a one-liner in the log will do. I 
tend to write rather longish log-entries because i have bad long-term 
memory...

And i think it would be good to announce roughly on the osxptb-dev 
mailinglist from time to time what you want to do, doesn't need to be 
much info, just to make sure that not multiple people make conflicting 
changes or duplicate work and such - and to make use of possible 
valuable feedback by the others...

&quot;beta&quot; is meant for code that has matured so far that it is worth 
testing by users that like to test the code - or are desperately waiting 
for a new feature and want to get their hands on it asap.

&quot;stable&quot; is for code that you consider stable for general use - in the 
sense that people can trust it for day to day work.

So it goes new stuff -&gt; trunk --- copy/merge into --&gt; beta --&gt; 
copy/merge into ---&gt; stable.

 From the stuff in stable one could make a new official release anytime 
that enough coherent stuff has piled up...

Denis thinks/thought? that the beta-branch is overkill and we should 
just go for trunk and stable. I think it is good as it is, at least when 
it comes to big changes in the code, although its a bit more work for us 
to do this merging, because it allows us to expose bleeding-edge stuff 
to users that are willing to take the risk and get valuable feedback 
while at the same time protecting naive users from using features that 
are known to fail in many occasions -- the name &quot;experimental&quot; would be 
probably a better choice for &quot;beta&quot;. If there is still disagreement from 
Denis or David with that i would drop beta, but i think it would either 
put the users to more risk or slow down development if we have to be too 
careful before releasing anything to users... This scheme is very common 
in many big open-source projects and works there...

These are all just guidelines that i find useful for my work. In the end 
  its a matter of common-sense of how to strictly follow these...


My work flow goes like this:

1. Login to computer...
2. Visit Berlios mailinglist and SVN web interface to see if anything 
changed in a way that i should take into account for what i wanna do.
3. svn update  -- to bring my local copy up to date to the latest state.
4. Work on code.
5. Whenever i changed something i wanna be able to easily undo in case 
of trouble, i commit it to Subversion with some meaningful log comment.
6. Whenever a single isolated thing is finished (new feature, or 
specific improvement to an existing feature, or a single bugfix for a 
single bug) i also commit to SVN.
7. Repeat from step 4 until done.


I think we are all still practising this new Subversion and new style of 
development thing and nothing is really set in stone. But its nice to 
have many people contributing now and the new process seems to be more 
efficient and scalable to me than the old one...

So what are you (intending to) work on?

I myself use the diary-function of my Berlios account as a scratchpas 
for ideas and to keep a todo list for myself to keep track of the 
features i'm working on, don't know if this is useful for others...

&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/developer/diary.php?diary_user=20591">http://developer.berlios.de/developer/diary.php?diary_user=20591</A>&gt;

Actually i think a 1.0.7 release at the beginning of next year wouldn't 
be a bad idea. Some significant changes are finished, e.g., Quicktime 
support is finished and stable, will move it into stable in the next 
days - just a few demos are missing, and i'll probably add a few more 
features and cleanups during the christmas break. I'll also try to 
reenable Offscreen-windows, single-buffer mode and WaitBlanking at least 
for &quot;Tiger&quot; users -- i don't think that Single-Buffer + WaitBlanking 
should be advertised *at all* for new code -- The flip method is better, 
but maybe it would make porting easier for users that just want to keep 
old code running. Tiger has new features (OpenGL Framebuffer objects) 
that should allow to efficiently merge offscreen windows with textures 
so one gets best of both worlds: Each texture can be efficiently used as 
offscreen window and each offscreen window efficiently as texture... -- 
This feature will only work on 10.4 not 10.3 though...

Best,
-mario
