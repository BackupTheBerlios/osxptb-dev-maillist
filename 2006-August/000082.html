<PRE>    I ran these tests with all other programs closed just to make sure 
that one of them wasn't interfering.  I don't have a virus scanner, the 
only thing I can imagine constantly doing stuff in the background would 
be Spotlight.  I'm at home so I can't give you the exact specs of my 
work computer, but I believe it is a dual G5 2GHz, with 2GB memory, and 
a GeForce 6600 w/ 256MB VRAM.  The main goal of trying to figure all 
this stuff out is to figure out why I get frame skips in the stimulus 
I'm coding up.  I'm worried that Matlab is deciding to go out to lunch 
and causing me to miss frames.
    If it's possible, if any of you could run the FlipTest for a 
duration of 8 seconds or so and do it several times, that would be great 
so I could see if it's just my machine.  I think it was every 1 out 5 
runs on average for me that have a timing blip.
