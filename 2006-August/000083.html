<PRE>dear mario

you say below that:
&gt;<i> The timing that GetSecs returns (as in FlipTest) is affected by  
</I>&gt;<i> operating system scheduling jitter.
</I>
oh dear. that's disappointing. I wrote GetSecs for OS9. It is based  
on a Mac OS9 call, UpTime, that accesses a hardware counter inside  
the PowerPC chip. Nothing ever interrupts that counter, so GetSecs  
always gives reliable time under OS9. We accessed that count through  
the Mac OS UpTime call, but it was my impression that a few lines of  
machine code would have done as well.

i could understand losing this capability with the Intel processor  
since that processor may not have the counter. But it would be my  
guess that all the powerpc chips have this counter and it seems a  
great shame not to use it. Being able to time things accurately from  
a high-level MATLAB program is invaluable. It allows users to test  
the timing of everything.

i googled UpTime (too many false hits) and AbsoluteToNanoseconds  
(better) and found many pages devoted to this. It appears to me that  
Apple has maintained support for this important call in Mac OS X.  
Thus there appears to be no reason for us not to continue using it.

However, Mario doesn't say whether the poor performance of GetSecs is  
due to switching to a new call, or due to a change in the Apple  
implementation of UpTime. It is conceivable that UpTime has been  
ruined, but I hope not.

If Apple has ruined UpTime by basing it on a less-reliable timer, I  
suspect that we could still get the counter value from the processor  
by a few lines of machine code. I don't know how to do that, but I  
suspect it would be fairly easy to figure out from a Motorola  
processor manual. It is likely that the necessary machine code would  
depend on which processor chip the Macintosh is using, so that the  
implementation of GetSecs would have to do a runtime check of which  
processor it's running on and use the appropriate machine code.

i think it would be valuable to make GetSecs reliable again, by  
figuring out how to get access to this counter in the newest OSes and  
processor chips. my guess is that it would be relatively easy.

it seems likely that the relevant Apple discussion list would include  
engineers that could give excellent pointers for how to get started,  
if indeed UpTime is ruined.

i've listed below the web pages about UpTime that seemed most  
helpful. several are very recent.
