The system scheduler determines when the timer is read.  That is  
independent of the precision of the timer itself.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i googled UpTime (too many false hits) and AbsoluteToNanoseconds

</I>&gt;<i> that Apple has maintained support for this important call in Mac OS  
</I>&gt;<i> X. Thus there appears to be no reason for us not to continue using it.
</I>
GetSecs does use the high-precision hardware timer.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Mario doesn't say whether the poor performance of GetSecs  
</I>&gt;<i> is due to switching to a new call, or due to a change in the Apple  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of UpTime. It is conceivable that UpTime has been  
</I>&gt;<i> ruined, but I hope not....
</I>
There is no problem with the timer.

As for dealing with the jitter in the Darwin scheduler:  That can be  
confined to set bounds.  Look at the parameters of the call which  
sets &quot;time constraint priority&quot;.  The limit of jitter is determined  
by parameters to that call.

The  &quot;time constraint priority&quot;  setting is reliable except for  
problems with the sigsetjmp call in MATLAB setting kernel locks.

best,

Allen

P.S.  I'll be out of town for a few days, so in case there is a  
followup discussion, get back to everyone later.
