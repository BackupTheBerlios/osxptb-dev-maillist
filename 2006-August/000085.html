<PRE>Allen is right, i made an inaccurate statement. The
precision of GetSecs itself is as good as on OS-9 on all
platforms. All operating systems use a high-res hardware
timer. I referred to the fact that there is a small random
delay between onset of vertical retrace and Matlab resuming
its execution, taking the GetSecs timestamp and such. 

When running under realtime priority (Time constraint in
OS-X language) this jitter/delay is usually below 1 msec
(My machine: 1.6 Ghz single proc G5 roughly 200
microseconds.) The update --&gt; sigsetjmp problem is gone in
10.4.7 due to improvements in Darwins kernel locking.
However, there are other factors that influence the timing
of a non-realtime general purpose system like OS-X and that
can only be eliminated/limited by very careful software
design and system setup, not by simply calling Priority()
(which only tells the scheduler to prioritize execution of
Matlab over all other processes). E.g., memory access: If
the system runs low on memory and needs to page in/out data
of the Matlab process to the swapfile, this will create
multi-millisecond random delays. Or if one uses hardware
with bad device drivers that introduce latencies and such.

These, usually very seldom, timing spikes are noticed by a
simple GetSecs measurement, but the Screen('Flip') command
compensates for such stuff by use of the display rasterbeam
position as an additional &quot;video-locked&quot; high precision
timesource to correct the internal GetSecs timestamp
appropriately. That is why 'Flip' always robustly reports
true stimulus onset, whereas the standard Screen('Flip');
t=GetSecs() method in FlipTest is affected by such random
delays. So 'Flip' tells you about real stimulus onset, the
discrepancy between 'Flip' timestamps and timestamps taken
with GetSecs tells you something about the timing noise
present in the execution of the Matlab code.

All in all the PTB timing facilities should be at
least/more robust and precise than the old PTB's one.

This all still doesn't solve Christophers problems though.
Such a machine as his one should have a much better timing,
unless something is screwed.

Sorry for the confusion &amp; best,
-mario

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; oh dear. that's disappointing. I wrote GetSecs for OS9.
</I>&gt;<i> It is based  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on a Mac OS9 call, UpTime, that accesses a hardware
</I>&gt;<i> counter inside  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the PowerPC chip. Nothing ever interrupts that counter,
</I>&gt;<i> so GetSecs  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always gives reliable time under OS9. We accessed that
</I>&gt;<i> count  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the Mac OS UpTime call, but it was my
</I>&gt;<i> impression that a few  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lines of machine code would have done as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The system scheduler determines when the timer is read.
</I>&gt;<i>  That is  
</I>&gt;<i> independent of the precision of the timer itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i could understand losing this capability with the
</I>&gt;<i> Intel processor  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since that processor may not have the counter. But it
</I>&gt;<i> would be my  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess that all the powerpc chips have this counter and
</I>&gt;<i> it seems a  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great shame not to use it. Being able to time things
</I>&gt;<i> accurately  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from a high-level MATLAB program is invaluable. It
</I>&gt;<i> allows users to  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; test the timing of everything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i googled UpTime (too many false hits) and
</I>&gt;<i> AbsoluteToNanoseconds  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (better) and found many pages devoted to this. It
</I>&gt;<i> appears to me  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that Apple has maintained support for this important
</I>&gt;<i> call in Mac OS  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; X. Thus there appears to be no reason for us not to
</I>&gt;<i> continue using it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GetSecs does use the high-precision hardware timer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, Mario doesn't say whether the poor performance
</I>&gt;<i> of GetSecs  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is due to switching to a new call, or due to a change
</I>&gt;<i> in the Apple  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation of UpTime. It is conceivable that UpTime
</I>&gt;<i> has been  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ruined, but I hope not....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no problem with the timer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for dealing with the jitter in the Darwin scheduler:
</I>&gt;<i>  That can be  
</I>&gt;<i> confined to set bounds.  Look at the parameters of the
</I>&gt;<i> call which  
</I>&gt;<i> sets &quot;time constraint priority&quot;.  The limit of jitter is
</I>&gt;<i> determined  
</I>&gt;<i> by parameters to that call.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The  &quot;time constraint priority&quot;  setting is reliable
</I>&gt;<i> except for  
</I>&gt;<i> problems with the sigsetjmp call in MATLAB setting kernel
</I>&gt;<i> locks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> best,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Allen
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.  I'll be out of town for a few days, so in case
</I>&gt;<i> there is a  
</I>&gt;<i> followup discussion, get back to everyone later.
