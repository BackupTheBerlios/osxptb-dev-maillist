<PRE>Hi all,

following my own advice, i've implemented some online-registration 
mechanism, ready for internal testing.

It works as follows:

At the end of each successfull download or update of PTB, the 
downloader/updater calls the PsychtoolboxPostInstallRoutine.m, which in 
turn calls the function PsychtoolboxRegistration.m

PsychtoolboxRegistration collects some info about the intalled PTB, 
e.g., &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;Matlab&quot; or &quot;Octave&quot;, Matlabversion, Operating 
system (OS-X,Windows,Linux), update or download, date of transaction and 
the MAC address of the primary network adapter as a unique identifier of 
the computer. It then assembles some one-line string of this info and 
sends it to our server, using the GPL'ed netcat utility, which is 
available by default on any OS-X/Linux system and included in PTB for 
M$-Windows. The script is robust against failing network connections and 
such, so even if online registration fails, the user should be left with 
a working working copy.

In the managementtools subfolder of trunk you'll find the shell script 
&quot;psychregistrationserver.sh&quot;. It implements the most minimalistic server 
that is conceivable. When started in a command window on the server 
machine, it will listen on port 2000 of the machine and write all 
registration info into a log file for later parsing.

What one of you needs to do:

1. Update to latest rev. of trunk.
2. On the server machine (www.psychtoolbox.org ?), enable port 2000 for 
incoming connections in the firewall settings of the machine.
3. Start the psychregistrationserver.sh script, following the 
instructions at the top of the file.
4. Modify PsychtoolboxRegistration.m so it accesses the server machine 
(currently set to &quot;localhost&quot; -&gt; replace by e.g,. &quot;www.psychtoolbox.org&quot;)

5. Play around with it and see if it works. Customize the help text of 
PsychtoolboxRegistration.m to your needs...

-&gt; You can select any port-number between 1025 and 65535, the number 
2000 was an arbitrary choice, just make sure its not used by anything 
else and the same port is given in server, firewall settings and M-File.

-&gt; Customize the server-script so it writes its log file somewhere else 
than /tmp/ptbregistrationlog.txt

-&gt; This simple server is not robust against receiving corrupted or 
invalid input or other unfriendly things, but we could replace it 
anytime by some own implementation...

The written log-file can be quickly parsed via some Unix commandline tools.

Examples: (Assuming /tmp/ptblog is the log file)

cut -d &quot;&lt;&quot; -f 1-3,10 /tmp/ptblog | grep beta | uniq -c
--&gt; Count total number of 'beta' flavors used.

cut -d &quot;&lt;&quot; -f 1-3 /tmp/testlog | uniq -c
--&gt; Count total number of installed working copies.

The MAC address (fields -f 1-3) is used to disambiguate multiple 
downloads/updates from the same machine, so each installation is only 
counted once.

For more complex statistics, we could write parsers in Matlab.

The stuff has been tested on Linux, OS-X 10.3.9, 10.4.7, Windows 2000/XP 
with multiple Matlab versions, so it should work.

Please give it a try, customize it etc. After some testing, we can merge 
it into beta and stable.

best,
-mario

</I>&gt;<i> please welcome Roy Han, who will be working part time, in my lab, during

</I>&gt;<i> in Neural Science at NYU.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i'd like to bring up an item for discussion. (this is not related to 
</I>&gt;<i> Roy's work.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we used to count downloads, and i think this is one of our more 
</I>&gt;<i> impressive stats. at present i have the impression that the berlios 
</I>&gt;<i> update system lacks download counting. mario and i have both lamented 
</I>&gt;<i> this, but haven't done anything about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i just read this in the FAQ page of a web site:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Q:* Why do I need to register the beta to use the full functionality?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *A:* Firstly, this allows us to track the number of MySync users more 
</I>&gt;<i> accurately than download figures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, it gives the registration system some exposure to the real world.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if we asked for an email address, to &quot;register&quot;, the list of unique 
</I>&gt;<i> email addresses would be a much more accurate estimate of how many 
</I>&gt;<i> people have downloaded our software, since multiple downloads by the 
</I>&gt;<i> same person would be largely discounted. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> actually, instead of recording an email address, we could record the IP 
</I>&gt;<i> address of the computer requesting the download. this is just as useful 
</I>&gt;<i> and doesn't require bothering the user. we can harvest IP addresses for 
</I>&gt;<i> both installation and update. we may not need to distinguish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once we have the unique IP addresses, i think there are two summary 
</I>&gt;<i> statistics we'd like, to impress potential users and funding agencies:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How many copies we've &quot;sold&quot;. Total count of unique IP addresses 
</I>&gt;<i> harvested in all time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. How many active users are there? Count the number of unique IP 
</I>&gt;<i> addresses harvested in the past 12 months.(We could restrict this to 
</I>&gt;<i> just Updates, on the grounds that perhaps we shouldn't count sites that 
</I>&gt;<i> only installed and never updated.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. We might want both for internal consumption, to detect trends in 
</I>&gt;<i> usage, but unless things are going very badly the two numbers will be 
</I>&gt;<i> very similar, and 1 will be bigger than 2 so we probably will just 
</I>&gt;<i> report 1. So that is the goal i recommend:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's collect the IP address of every download/update, and count how 
</I>&gt;<i> many are unique.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i realize that keeping statistics is a diversion from developing the 
</I>&gt;<i> Psychtoolbox itself, but some stats have been very valuable in the past 
</I>&gt;<i> (especially the list of grants and papers that cite us), and the IP 
</I>&gt;<i> count cannot be generated at the last minute, so if something like this 
</I>&gt;<i> is possible it might be worth investing a bit of time into now.  i'm 
</I>&gt;<i> sure that what i'm suggesting is doable, but i don't know whether it'd 
</I>&gt;<i> be hard or easy. that would affect whether we'll want to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (artists call this &quot;documenting&quot;. in the era of happenings and 
</I>&gt;<i> installations, the event may leave no professionally-adequate trace 
</I>&gt;<i> unless someone makes an effort to record and document its occurrence.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> best
