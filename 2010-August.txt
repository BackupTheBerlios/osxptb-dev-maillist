Subject: [Osxptb-dev] Xcode 3.2 compilation and Octave
Message-ID: <4C647098.4080302@vanderbilt.edu>

Hey,
I would like to look into ramping up the Octave support (just for OSX 
for right now). But first I want to recompile a typical target like 
'GetSecs intel'. I used the project files in the PsychSourceGL/Projects 
and they load just fine. I read the README file in the PsychSourceGL and 
it stated:

"B. If your MATLAB path is /Applications/SomethingElse where 
SomethingElse names a version of MATLAB better than MATLAB701, then 
either this file is out of date or the project itself is out of date. 
Please send mail to the Psychtoolbox forum and we will correct it."

I'm using version 2010a (Xcode version 3.2 on snow leopard) and there 
isn't a "mexversion.c" file located anywhere within the Matlab 
application package. How do I go about compiling one of the Intel 
targets? Also, I noticed that some of the OSX specific source files 
(like 'Source/OSX/Screen/PsychMovieSupport.h') have a typo in the 
inclusion of Quick Time headers.

Currently: #include<Quicktime/Movies.h>
Should be: #include<QuickTime/Movies.h>

Thanks,
Jurnell

  Mario,

The Matlab & Octave features are about equal. I found what I was looking 
for (Keyboard input supplied through PsychHID).

Concerning Xcode usage, in version 3.2 (not sure when it was added) 
there's a setting to allow for backwards compatibility of project files 
distinctly, "Xcode 2.4-compatible." There's no rush though.

Is there a list of outstanding bugs or unimplemented features somewhere?

Jurnell
