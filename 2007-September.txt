Subject: [Osxptb-dev] OS-X Psychtoolbox and realtime operation for EEG
	acquisition
Message-ID: <46F7F5FC.2000303@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu>

Hello,

This question is for people who have used the Matlab psychtoolbox in EEG 
and/or MEG (requiring accuracy in the range of milliseconds.)

The document below indicates that if used correctly, Mac-OSX can achieve 
realtime uninterupted operation at millisecond-scale accuracy, even 
though the system is not designed for hard realtime operation.

My question is, as EEG users of Psychtoolbox, have you encountered any 
difficult problems in getting realtime performance?  Did you find it 
worked well and reliably?

Thanks,
Rob
