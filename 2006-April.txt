Subject: [Osxptb-dev] Possible bugfix for crashes in PsychHID / DAQ-Toolbox...
Message-ID: <web-18587565@tuebingen.mpg.de>

Hi all,

using the old libHIDUtils.a that Allen sent me, i was able
to rebuild the (hopefully) bug-fixed version of PsychHID
that should be hopefully less crash-prone when using
PsychHID('GetReports') and friends (e.g., DAQ toolbox).

I don't have a DAQ (and i'm lazy), could therefore only do
very basic testing, so its your turn. Attached is the new
PsychHID to replace the PsychHID.mexmac in
Psychtoolbox/PsychHardware/

Please test and give feedback asap, so i can merge it into
'beta' and 'stable' soon if it is an improvement.

best,
-mario

Hi Mario,

Just occured to me, since a lot of messages on the PTB are about the  
"warning sign".

Why not actually include a message like this one (approx. your words  
of message #4432) as part of the warning:

"This warning is meant to direct your attention to
the output in the Matlab window because some (potentially serious)
display timing problem was detected."


Or perhaps (or additional) direct user to a web page that explains  
all the intricate details of timing, warnings, etc.
Might save a lot of frustration and typing the same responses over  
and over again.

I thought about disabling the whole light-show, but i'm not sure... It 
mostly seems to create confusion and is not that useful. I already 
disabled the flicker-test sheet on dual-disp. setups and replaced it by 
the PerceptualVLBSyncTest.m file. The main reason there isn't any text 
message instead of the warning sign is because we cannot call 'DrawText' 
from inside PTBs code the way it is implemented at the moment, so 
outputting text is difficult, unless i change the drawtext implementation.

Otoh one should expect people to read output in the Matlab window, but 
then the output is a bit to verbose to be read all the time...

Thanks for the suggestion.

I made another attempt in fixing MorphDemo for your hardware. Could you 
update your beta and try again? If it works now then it wasn't a bug (by 
the strict definition of bug) in OS-X, but just pretty bad system design 
by Apple ;)
