Jap. I think the script needs some modification to be safe. It was 
written before the M$-Windows port and is only needed if someone creates 
code with the wrong linefeed mode set in XCode (needs to be Unix-Style). 
Editing the files under M$-Windows creates characters that the script 
does not handle properly, so it introduces lots of messy linefeeds...

This needs some thoughts and testing before its useable again...

&gt;<i> updated guidelines so no one makes the same mistake I did.  Also, no one 
</I>&gt;<i> replied to my question about pthreads and Matlab compatibility.  Would 
</I>&gt;<i> you be the one to ask about that or is there a resource on the web that 
</I>&gt;<i> I can use to illuminate the subject?
</I>
Regarding the PThreads: Avoid multi-threading if you can!

In theory, there is no fundamental reason why starting and managing our 
own threads via the pthreads-API should cause trouble with Matlab. 
Matlab doesn't know about our threads, and doesn't care.

The one place were i introduced pthreads is for the asynchronous movie 
loading under OS-X, because there is no other way to implement that 
functionality and it seems to be a very useful feature.

In practice, there are many reasons to avoid threads in PTB if the same 
task can be solved in a single-threaded way:

1. Multi-threaded programming is difficult: You can easily introduce a 
lot of weird bugs that are very hard to fix. Locking issues, 
race-conditions and such. That does not apply only to PTB, but to any 
multi-threaded app.

2. OpenGL is not thread-safe: You are not allowed to access the same 
OpenGL context from multiple threads simultaneously, so you have to be 
very careful with all OpenGL ops. This can even crash the whole desktop.

3. Matlab or Octave is not thread-safe: You are not allowed to call any 
Matlab/Octave function from a thread other than the main thread. This 
rules out all functions in PsychScriptingGlue for accessing or returning 
data from/to Matlab. All memory allocations via PsychMallocTemp() and 
friends are bound to crash from your threads. Any kind of printf(), 
fprintf() or errror output via PsychErrorExitMsg() and such will 
possibly crash Matlab... You need to inspect each Psychtoolbox function 
if it doesn't indirectly access Matlab...

4. Threads have a limited stack-size, so allocating too much memory in 
local variables of functions can crash, unless you know how to handle this.

5. Some functions in some libraries are not thread-safe or reentrant, so 
you need to know very well which functions are allowed and which not.

6. Psychtoolbox itself is not thread-safe or reentrant. Its design 
doesn't protect against parallelism in accessing internal data 
structures or other ressources.

7. Timing and priority issues: Specific pieces of PTB code, e.g., the 
Screen('Flip') command depend on the fact that the main-thread gets all 
the computation time it needs when it needs it. If you start parallel 
threads inside PTB, they could steal cpu cycles from the main thread in 
exactly the wrong moment and mess up stimulus timing.

8. The multi-threading needs to work on OS-X, Linux and M$-Windows, each 
of them has different scheduling behaviour...

9. There are some weird interactions between Quicktime on OS-X (which is 
highly multi-threaded) and Matlab when running with JVM: Playing some 
movies can hang or crash Matlab in some situations. The reason is 
unclear, except that it is threading related, i failed completely in 
debugging it. The only thing i know is that running matlab in -nojvm 
mode makes it reliable, probably because then a lot of Java related 
threads don't run anymore.

So all in all, its not impossible to use threads in PTB, but it is 
pretty difficult and needs a lot of care if you want to do it. Although 
i have a lot of experience with multi-threaded and realtime parallel 
programming from many other projects, i'll try to avoid it in PTB 
whenever i can.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It also creates merge-conflicts which are very painful to resolve

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
